# tiny13softoff
This is a generic implementation for a soft-off circuit I've created. It runs
an ATtiny13 at the lowest possible current to minimize power dissipation and
essentially only is a smart timer circuit. To achieve this, it runs at the
lowest possible internal clock speed, 16 kHz (128 kHz with the CKDIV8 fuse) and
uses power saving modes. With both input pullups active, it runs at about 80ÂµA
at 5V. 

# Schematic
The schematic has been drawn with Altium CircuitMaker and [is also available at
Altium Vault](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/johndoe31415/softoff).
Fuses of the ATtiny13 need to be programmed in the following way:

```-U lfuse:w:0x6b:m -U hfuse:w:0xff:m```
